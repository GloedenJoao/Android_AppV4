# Guidance for AI contributors

- Use Jetpack Compose and Material 3 components whenever UI changes are required.
- Favor immutable data classes for view state and keep business logic in `FinanceViewModel`.
- When updating README.md or this file, refresh any feature lists and setup steps if they change.
- Prefer Portuguese copy for any UX strings or helper text in UI examples.
